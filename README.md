# Microscope
This is a data entry program that was created by me as a research assistant while at the University of Minnesota for the Cosmic Ray Research group headed by Phylis Fryer (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllis_S._Freier) and C. J. Waddington (Jake Waddington). It was used when looking at photographic emulsions through a microscope that were exposed to cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere carried by helium balloons. The types of tracks and atomic interactions that these cosmic rays made in the emulsions were recorded and cataloged using this Macintosh software. It was written in TML Pascal for the Mac. I don't have a good idea of what all the differences in the versions of source code here are, but I wanted to provide it for posterity.
